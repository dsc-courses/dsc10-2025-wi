    "Welcome to the Midterm Project! Projects in DSC 10 are similar in format to homeworks, but are different in a few key ways. First, a project is comprehensive, meaning that it draws upon everything we've learned this quarter so far. Second, since problems can vary quite a bit in difficulty, some problems will be worth more points than others. Finally, in a project, the problems are more open-ended; they will usually ask for some result, but won't tell you what method should be used to get it. There might be several equally-valid approaches, and several steps might be necessary. This is closer to how data science is done in \"real life.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that you **start early** on the project! It will take the place of a homework in the week that it is due, but you should also expect it to take longer than a homework. You are especially encouraged to **find a partner** to work through the project with. If you work in a pair, you must follow the [Project Partner Guidelines](https://dsc10.com/project-partners/) on the course website. In particular, you must work together at the same time, and you are not allowed to split up the project and each work on certain problems. If you work with a partner, only one of you needs to upload your notebook to Gradescope; after uploading, you'll see an option to add the other partner to the submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** The `otter` tests don't usually tell you that your answer is correct. More often, they help catch basic mistakes. It's up to you to ensure that your answer is correct. If you're not sure, ask someone (not for the answer, but for some guidance about your approach). Directly sharing answers between groups is not okay, but discussing problems with the course staff or with other students is encouraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avoid looping through DataFrames unless instructed to do so. Do not import any packages.** Loops in Python are slow, and looping through DataFrames should usually be avoided in favor of the DataFrame methods we've learned in class, which are much faster. Please do not import any additional packages ‚Äì you don't need them, and our autograder may not be able to run your code if you do.\n",

We encourage you to explore the dataset further by asking and answering your own questions about the Spotify charts. For instance, we didn't use the `'streams'` column in `charts` at all. Maybe you're interested in looking at the number of streams per week for your favorite song. Or maybe you're interested in recreating the interactive plot from the end of Section 5, but instead of looking at the age of each week's #1 song, you want to look at the number of streams of each week's #1 song. Explore, and let us know what you find!"
