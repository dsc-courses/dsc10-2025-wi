To encourage more students to buy Lucky Triton Lotto tickets despite the terrible odds, there are some additional prizes. Students can win Triton Cash if *some* of their numbers match the corresponding winning numbers, as described in the introduction. Again, simulate the act of buying 100,000 tickets, but this time find **the greatest number of matches achieved by any of your tickets**, and assign this number to `most_matches`. \n",

    "## 4. BLACKPINK World Tour🖤💗\n",
    "\n",
    "On February 5, 2025, YG Entertainment announced that the K-Pop girl group, BLACKPINK (블랙핑크), will be going on a [world tour](https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a63676009/how-to-get-tickets-to-blackpink-2025-world-tour/) later this year. Fans were happy but surprised to hear the news as the group has not released any music together since 2022. Furthermore, all the artists in the group have been focusing on their solo careers, so it did not seem likely they would be going on a concert tour anytime soon. The tour dates have not been announced yet, but based on the their previous tours, they will likely perform at these 4 cities in Asia:\n",

    "- Seoul, South Korea\n",
    "- Tokyo, Japan\n",
    "- Bangkok, Thailand\n",
    "- Singapore, Singapore\n",

    "You and your friends are planning a trip to Asia to see BLACKPINK. Since you have a limited budget and will already spend a lot of money on the concert tickets, you want to stay in the city which has the cheapest hotels. You gathered hotel data from [Expedia](https://www.expedia.com/) for the four cities above. The `hotels` DataFrame contains a **sample** of all the hotels in the four cities above. Each row corresponds to a particular hotel, and the columns give us information about the `'Hotel Name'`, the `'City'`, the `'Price'` in USD for one night, and the `'Customer Rating'` from 1-10. "
